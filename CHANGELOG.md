# Changelog

## 0.5.0 (2026-09-10)

### Added

- `bayesian_g2` / `G2Posterior`: exact-Poisson Bayesian posterior of
  the raw central-window g2 ratio. Conjugate Gamma updates on the
  central and reference per-bin rates (Jeffreys prior by default)
  give a closed-form scaled beta-prime posterior for the ratio:
  exact density, CDF, quantiles, equal-tailed credible intervals,
  posterior mean/median/mode, and the triage verdict probability
  P[g2 < 1/2 | data]. Acquisition time and detection rates cancel in
  the ratio, so none are needed. The estimand (window-averaged raw
  g2, an upper bound on g2(0)) is stated plainly; dip-shape-aware
  inference remains `profile_likelihood_ci`.
- Anchors: hand-built law against `scipy.stats.betaprime` to 1e-12;
  unit mass and closed-form moments by quadrature; agreement with a
  direct numerical marginalization of the exact Poisson likelihood
  over the nuisance rate; seeded Monte-Carlo Gamma-ratio CDF
  agreement; nominal credible-interval coverage on twin-generated
  histograms; verdict ordering of single- versus two-emitter sites.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- `background_corrected_g2`: exact inversion of the Poissonian-
  background map g2_meas = 1 + rho^2 (g2_true - 1) (Brouri et al.,
  Opt. Lett. 25, 1294 (2000)) -- the same forward model as the
  package's `g2_zero(..., rho)`, so the round trip is machine-exact
  and asserted in the tests. Maps confidence-interval endpoints
  through the same affine transform, truncates at the physical floor
  while returning the untruncated value, refuses rho outside (0, 1].
- `signal_fraction`: rho = S/(S+B) with input validation.
- `deadtime_corrected_rate`: exact inversion of the non-paralyzable
  dead-time throughput r_meas = r/(1 + r tau_d), validated against
  the Monte-Carlo detector chain statistically; refuses rates at or
  beyond saturation instead of extrapolating.

### Changed

- CI matrix: Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
