# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- `background_corrected_g2`: exact inversion of the Poissonian-
  background map g2_meas = 1 + rho^2 (g2_true - 1) (Brouri et al.,
  Opt. Lett. 25, 1294 (2000)) -- the same forward model as the
  package's `g2_zero(..., rho)`, so the round trip is machine-exact
  and asserted in the tests. Maps confidence-interval endpoints
  through the same affine transform, truncates at the physical floor
  while returning the untruncated value, refuses rho outside (0, 1].
- `signal_fraction`: rho = S/(S+B) with input validation.
- `deadtime_corrected_rate`: exact inversion of the non-paralyzable
  dead-time throughput r_meas = r/(1 + r tau_d), validated against
  the Monte-Carlo detector chain statistically; refuses rates at or
  beyond saturation instead of extrapolating.

### Changed

- CI matrix: Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
